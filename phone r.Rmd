## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#library
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(GGally)
```
```{r}
# 2. Understanding the Structure

# View the structure of the dataset
str(phone)

# View the first few rows
head(phone)

# 3. Summary Statistics

# Summary statistics
summary(phone)

# Detailed summary using skimr
skim(phone)
```
```{r}
# 4. Missing Values

# Check for missing values
missing_values <- sapply(phone, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
missing_values
```
## Including Plots



```{r }
# Histogram for a numeric variable
ggplot(phone, aes(x =px_width)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "brown", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
# Histogram for a numeric variable
ggplot(phone, aes(x =px_height )) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth =30, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal()
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Boxplot for a numeric variable grouped by a categorical variable
ggplot(phone, aes(x = px_height, y =px_width)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "orange", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
# Scatter plot to visualize relationships between two numeric variables
ggplot(phone, aes(x =ram, y = mobile_wt)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()
```
